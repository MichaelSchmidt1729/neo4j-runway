Missing values: Some columns have missing values, notably UTILITIES_PROCEED, PAYROLL_PROCEED, MORTGAGE_INTEREST_PROCEED, RENT_PROCEED, REFINANCE_EIDL_PROCEED, HEALTH_CARE_PROCEED and DEBT_INTEREST_PROCEED.

Numerical Features: CurrentApprovalAmount, JobsReported, UTILITIES_PROCEED, PAYROLL_PROCEED, MORTGAGE_INTEREST_PROCEED, RENT_PROCEED, REFINANCE_EIDL_PROCEED, HEALTH_CARE_PROCEED and DEBT_INTEREST_PROCEED are numerical variables. They can provide insights into the amount of loans approved and how they are intended to be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Loan Usage: The features detailing loan usage (like UTILITIES_PROCEED, PAYROLL_PROCEED, etc.) provide a breakdown of how businesses plan to use their loans. This could be important for understanding the needs of businesses and the economic impacts of these loans. \n",
      "\n",

For instance, the property 'CurrentApprovalAmount' could be converted to a separate node 'ApprovalAmount'. Similarly, 'JobsReported' could be converted into 'Jobs'.
